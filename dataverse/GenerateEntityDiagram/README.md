# Use metadata to generate entity diagrams

Visual representation of metadata can be very useful, especially when you're trying to describe the relationship between entities in the system. You can use the Metadata Diagram program to generate entity relationship diagrams. You can create a simple diagram that shows a relationship for just one entity or a complex diagram that includes dozens of related entities, including custom and system entities.

## What this sample does

This sample shows two new custom entities created in Microsoft Dataverse. The first entity represents a bank account and the second entity represents a safe deposit box. The following entity diagram was generated by using the Metadata Diagram tool. It shows the relationship between the `new_bankaccount` entity, the `new_safedepositbox` entity, and other entities in the system. The names shown are the logical entity names. If there are multiple relationships between the same two entities, only one line is drawn in the diagram for simplicity.

## Prerequisites

1. Download and install Microsoft Visio.
1. Launch the Visual Studio installer and verify that the **Visual Studio Tools for Office** component is installed or install it.

## How to run this sample

You can run the sample in Visual Studio with no changes needed. Alternatively, you can run a list of entity names on the command line when executing the program to generate a diagram containing those entities.

For example, from within the `bin/Debug` folder of the project (where the exe file is located), run the following command. The `account` and `contact` variables are the names of entities. Your first entity name is the name of your generated Visio file. In this case, the name is `account`, so you find `account.vsd` in your `bin/Debug` folder after running the sample.

```cmd
GenerateEntityDiagram.exe account contact
```

> [!TIP]
> To change the connection string information, uncomment it in `App.config` and replace `Username` and `Url` with your own account username and environment URL.
